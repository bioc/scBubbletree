Description: scBubbletree is a scalable and quantitative method for 
  the visual exploration of scRNA-seq data that preserves biologically 
  meaningful properties, including local and global cell distances and 
  cell density distributions across samples. It effectively addresses 
  overplotting issues and enables the visualization of diverse cell 
  attributes derived from multiomic single-cell experiments. Furthermore, 
  scBubbletree is user-friendly and easily integrates with popular 
  scRNA-seq data analysis approaches, facilitating comprehensive and 
  intuitive data interpretation.
