Description: scBubbletree is a quantitative method for the visual 
    exploration of scRNA-seq data, preserving key biological 
    properties such as local and global cell distances and cell 
    density distributions across samples. It effectively resolves 
    overplotting and enables the visualization of diverse cell 
    attributes from multiomic single-cell experiments. Additionally, 
    scBubbletree is user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with 
    popular scRNA-seq analysis tools, facilitating comprehensive 
    and intuitive data interpretation.
