Description: Visual exploration is an integral part of scRNA-seq data analysis.
  scBubbletree is a quantitative method for visual exploration of scRNA-seq 
  data. scBubbletree was designed to overcome challenges associated with the 
  rapid growth of the scale of scRNA-seq datasets, such as overplotting, and to 
  accurately preserve the local and global structure of the data. The workflow
  of scBubbletree is easy-to-use and allows seamless integrate with popular 
  approaches for scRNA-seq data analysis.
