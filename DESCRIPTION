Description: Visual exploration is an integral part of scRNA-seq data 
  analysis. scBubbletree is a quantitative method for visual exploration 
  of scRNA-seq data. scBubbletree was designed to overcome challenges 
  associated with the rapid growth of the scale of scRNA-seq datasets, 
  such as overplotting, and to accurately preserve the local and global 
  structure of the data. scBubbletree is easy-to-use and allows seamless 
  integrate with popular approaches for scRNA-seq data analysis.
